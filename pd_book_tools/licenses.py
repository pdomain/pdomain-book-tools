"""Shared SPDX license identifier allowlist.

``pd_book_tools`` is the foundation library every ``pd-*`` repo depends on,
so it is the cheapest single source of truth for license-identifier
validation. Without a shared allowlist each downstream tool hand-rolls its
own subset and they drift — one accepts ``Apache-2.0``, another typos it,
and nothing catches the mismatch.

This module exposes a data-driven allowlist of SPDX license identifiers:

* :data:`SPDX_VALID_IDS` -- a :class:`frozenset` of every valid SPDX
  ``licenseId`` string.
* :func:`is_valid_spdx_id` -- a small validation helper.

The data is vendored as ``pd_book_tools/data/spdx_licenses.json`` (sourced
from the SPDX ``license-list-data`` project) rather than hand-curated, and
rather than pulling in a third-party package -- a runtime dependency here
would ripple into every consumer's install closure.

The API is intentionally license-domain-generic (no consumer-specific
naming). Expected consumers include synthetic-data font licensing,
dataset/model-card metadata, and public-domain rights markers on
submission packages.

SPDX identifiers are case-sensitive: ``Apache-2.0`` is valid, ``apache-2.0``
is not. :func:`is_valid_spdx_id` matches exactly.
