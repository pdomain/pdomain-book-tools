"""Human-review metadata for OCR words, lines (blocks), and pages.

This module is foundation-level: it carries no per-app logic and is
designed to be shared across every consumer of pd-book-tools data models
(labeler, pgdp-prep, proofreader, simple-ocr-gui).

The dataclass is intentionally minimal in this first revision. A future
extension migrates ``ReviewMetadata`` to a list of per-pass review
records (P1/P2/P3/F1/F2 in Distributed Proofreaders parlance) once the
proofreader app spec lands. Until then, treat it as a single most-recent
review state.
