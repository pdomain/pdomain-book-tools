    The mathematical IoU of two identical sets is 1.0 even when they have
    zero measure, but layout code here uses IoU as a "do these rectangles
    meaningfully overlap" signal — and a pair of zero-area boxes carries no
    spatial coverage to overlap on. Treating them as non-overlapping
    (returning 0.0) is the intentional convention for this module so
    deduplication / cluster passes don't collapse degenerate point-regions
    against each other. Callers that need exact-equality detection on
    layout regions should compare coordinates directly, not via IoU.

    return (`if inter <= 0`) catches mismatched zero-area inputs; the
