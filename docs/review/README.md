## Highest-priority fixes

Start here before anything else:

1. **H-01** `encoding.py` — PNG channel swap (all image previews have wrong colors)
2. **H-02** `pgdp_results.py` — unescaped `.` in 13 diacritic regexes (silent data corruption)
3. **H-03** `ipynb_widgets.py` — malformed HTML output (missing tags)
4. **H-04** `page.py` — `recompute_bounding_box` undefined → `AttributeError` on all editing ops
5. **H-05** `bounding_box.py` — `_vertical_crop` coordinate-system flip for pixel-space boxes
6. **H-06** `word.py` — `crop_bottom`/`crop_top` can store `None` as `bounding_box`
7. **H-07** `block.py` — `mean_ocr_confidence` crashes after any `Word.split()`
8. **H-08** `block.py` — `Block.from_dict` calls `BoundingBox.from_dict(None)`
9. **H-12** `document.py` — DocTR `original_text` indexes by character, not page
10. **H-14/15/16** `threshold.py` — Cupy Otsu off-by-one, crash on uniform images, wrong return type

## Loop progress

Durable state for the `/loop` bug-fix run, so a fresh session can resume without
remembering prior turns. Update this when an iteration completes (after the
`docs(review): mark H-XX fixed` commit).

**Fixed so far:**

- H-01 `encoding.py` BGR/RGB swap — fix `702d402`, doc mark `b4f1140`
- H-02 `pgdp_results.py` unescaped diacritic `.` regexes — fix `6b1ff5b`, doc mark `466d1df`
- H-03 `ipynb_widgets.py` malformed HTML (operator-precedence) — fix `1f26286`, doc mark `e0da955`
- H-04 `page.py` `Page.recompute_bounding_box` was reported missing but was
  actually implemented in commit `2248366` (April 2025); review was stale —
  regression-locked via test in fix `bd4ece9`, doc mark `24b97f0`
- H-05 `bounding_box.py` `_vertical_crop` discarded `original_is_normalized`
  and always normalized output — fix `2327d2f`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-06 `word.py` `crop_bottom` / `crop_top` overwrote `self.bounding_box`
  with `None` on the blank-ROI warning path — fix `645c825`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-07 `block.py` `Block.mean_ocr_confidence` raised `TypeError` because
  `ocr_confidence_scores()` can contain `None` after any `Word.split()` —
  fix `42da1ac`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-08 `block.py` `Block.from_dict` called `BoundingBox.from_dict(None)`
  when deserializing a block whose `bounding_box` was serialized as JSON
  `null` — fix `3163feb`, doc mark `<pending>`. Note: `Page.from_dict`
  already had the equivalent guard, so the review's parenthetical claim
  about `Page.from_dict` was partly stale.
- H-12 `document.py` `from_doctr_result` passed `doctr_result.render()`
  (a single `str`) as `original_text`, which `from_doctr_output` then
  indexed by `page_idx` — yielding one character per page since `str` is
  a `Sequence[str]`. Existing test mocked `render.return_value` as a
  list, masking the bug. Fixed to pass
  `[page.render() for page in doctr_result.pages]`. — fix `06f22c3`,
  doc mark `<pending>`
- H-14 `image_processing/cupy_processing/threshold.py` `otsu_binary_thresh`
  defined `weight2 = weight1[-1] - weight1` (exclusive suffix sum), which
  combined with `weight2[1:]` / `mean2[1:]` in the variance expression
  excluded bin `k+1` from both classes and biased the threshold high on
  realistic bimodal images. Switched to
  `weight2 = cp.flip(cp.cumsum(cp.flip(hist)))` (inclusive suffix sum,
  matching `skimage.filters.threshold_otsu`). Verified live with cupy and
  skimage: pre-fix threshold ~0.55, fixed and skimage both ~0.42 on
  overlapping Gaussian clusters. — fix `2e1b2be`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-15 `image_processing/cupy_processing/threshold.py` `otsu_binary_thresh`
  on uniform-valued images. The reviewed crash (`ValueError: max must be
  larger than min` from `cp.histogram(..., range=(min, max))`) no longer
  reproduces on cupy 14.x — the histogram call now silently produces a
  bogus single-bin distribution over an arbitrary [-0.5, 0.5]-style edge
  span, so `cp.argmax` of an all-zero between-class variance returns 0
  and the function emits a meaningless threshold (~`-0.498`) and an
  all-1.0 mask for an all-zero input. Added an early return when
  `min_val == max_val` that emits an all-zero binary mask, matching
  skimage/cv2 semantics (uniform image's Otsu threshold is the uniform
  value itself; strict-`>` binarization is therefore all-zero). Review
  was partly stale on the symptom but the underlying defect (no uniform
  guard) was real. — fix `92d7c32`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-16 `image_processing/cupy_processing/threshold.py` `otsu_binary_thresh`
  returned `cp.float32` 0.0/1.0 while the cv2 backend's same-named function
  returns `uint8` 0/255. Pipeline code switching backends silently got
  incompatible dtype/range, breaking downstream `invert_image` etc. Aligned
  cupy's contract to `cp.uint8` {0, 255}; updated the H-15 uniform-image
  early-return to emit uint8 too; simplified `np_uint8_float_binary_thresh`
  wrapper since the underlying call now returns 0/255 already. — fix
  `53ed3f5`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-09 `ocr/word.py` `Word.from_dict` used hard key access
  `dict["ocr_confidence"]`, raising `KeyError` on legacy JSON serialized
  before `ocr_confidence` was added. `Character.from_dict` already used
  `.get()`; aligned `Word.from_dict` to the same tolerant pattern so
  missing key defaults to `None`. — fix `a0170a4`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-10 `ocr/document.py` `from_tesseract` passed Tesseract's `conf == -1`
  rejected-word sentinel through `safe_float`, which stored it as a real
  `-1.0`. The negative value then passed `rotation.py`'s
  `word.ocr_confidence is not None` guard, dragging `_mean_confidence`
  below the 0.6 rotation threshold and triggering spurious 90/180/270
  probes on clean pages; it also corrupted `Block.mean_ocr_confidence`
  and confidence-based filters. Added `Document._tesseract_confidence`
  that maps `conf <= 0` (and NaN / non-numeric / None) to `None`, leaving
  `safe_float` (used for box geometry where 0.0 is the right default)
  untouched. — fix `4c946b2`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-11 `ocr/document.py` `from_tesseract` did `Word(text=str(word_row.text))`
  for every word row. When Tesseract emits a rejected/empty row the pandas
  `text` cell is `NaN`, and `str(float('nan'))` is the literal string
  `'nan'`, producing a ghost Word that propagated as real OCR output into
  ground-truth matching and final text. Added `Document._tesseract_text`
  mapping `NaN` / `None` to the empty string and used it at the word
  ingest site. Row geometry is preserved as an empty-text Word — we do
  not silently drop OCR rows. — fix `779bd59`, doc mark `<pending>`
- H-13 `ocr/doctr_support.py` `get_finetuned_torch_doctr_predictor` did
  `Path.exists(dectection_pt_file)` as if `Path.exists` were a classmethod.
  It worked accidentally for `Path` arguments (descriptor binding) but
  raised `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'stat'` on
  Python 3.13 when callers passed `str`, despite the function's
  `PathLike` parameter contract. Existing tests passed `tmp_path / "..."`
  so they masked the bug. Fixed to `Path(x).exists()` for both files;
  added a regression test exercising the missing-files branch with `str`
  paths. — fix `ed5937b`, doc mark `<pending>`

- H-17 `pyproject.toml` declared both `opencv-python` and
  `opencv-contrib-python`. They install to the same `cv2` namespace so
  pip resolves them independently and whichever wheel unpacks last wins,
  making runtime behavior nondeterministic (esp. contrib-only modules
  like xfeatures2d / SIFT). Audited every `cv2` import in
  `pd_book_tools/`: all use functions present in base OpenCV, so contrib
  alone covers everything. Dropped `opencv-python` and added
  `tests/test_packaging.py` with regression assertions over
  `pyproject.toml` (also guards against full+headless mixing).
  Lockfile refresh deferred to the user. — fix `364bcd2`,
  doc mark `<pending>`

**Top-10 H-XX list complete.** Every entry from the "Highest-priority
fixes" section above is now resolved. The /loop now sweeps the remaining
`bugs-high.md` entries top-to-bottom — pick the first unstruck H-XX from
the file in document order.

**Next pick:** H-18 — `ocr/document.py` Tesseract hierarchy uses
`block_idx + 1` instead of the actual `block_num` from the Tesseract
DataFrame (lines 526, 548, 569 per the review). When Tesseract emits
non-contiguous block numbers (skipped indices, OCR rejects), using the
positional `block_idx + 1` desynchronizes the reconstructed
block/paragraph/line hierarchy from Tesseract's own numbering, leading
to mis-grouped words. Verify by grepping `document.py` for `block_idx +
1` / `par_idx + 1` / `line_idx + 1` and the surrounding TSV column
access; if the production code already uses `block_num`/`par_num`/
`line_num` from the DataFrame, mark the entry stale.

**Workflow per iteration** (one bug per commit, no push):

1. Verify bug still present in the production code.
2. Write a failing test that reproduces the symptom from the review doc.
3. Implement minimal fix; re-run test; run module test suite for regressions.
4. Commit `fix(<module>): <one-line>` referencing the review ID in the body.
5. Edit `docs/review/bugs-*.md`: prepend `[FIXED in <short-sha>]` and wrap the
   heading text in `~~...~~` (matching H-01..H-03 format).
6. Update **Fixed so far** and **Next pick** in this README.
7. Commit `docs(review): mark H-XX fixed`.
